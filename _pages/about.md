This is Yunhe Yan(严云鹤)'s home on the web.  
  
I'm currently a junior undergraduate student in Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, major in Computer Science and Technology.  
  
Up to now, My research experience is mainly in GNN field. I worked as a long time research intern in GAMMA lab, BUPT for the past year, and contributed to a novel paper submmited to NeurIPS in May, 2023 as third author.  
  
My current research interest is focus on graph neural network, data mining, extending to knowledge graph reasoning and information extraction. I am also particularly interested in security and distributed system, especially security and distributed system in ML. But currently I know little about them as research topics so far.  
  
My CV can be found in this website, and I will keep blogging on it, recording my reflections on various topics.
