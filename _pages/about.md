This is Yunhe Yan(严云鹤)'s home on the web.  
  
I'm currently a Phd student in Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, major in Computer Science and Technology.  
  
My past research experience is mainly in GNN field. I worked as a long time research intern in GAMMA lab, BUPT for the past two years, and contributed to a novel paper accepted by AAAI 2024 as third author.
  
My current research interest is focus on mobile agent, data mining, extending to information extraction. I am also particularly interested in security and distributed system, especially security and distributed system in ML. But currently I know little about them as research topics so far.  
  
My CV can be found in this website, and I will keep blogging on it, recording my reflections on various topics.
